    Hello! Welcome to the page for Kevin You's final project for 15-418.
    I will explore implementing a parallelized version of the Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) fluid simulator.
    Note that I have worked with Katerina Nikiforova through the early stages of this project.
    However, we have decided to take the project to our own directions, and thus we will be submitting separate final reports.
    <a href=https://kn1451j.github.io/ParallelFluidSim/> This </a> is Katerina's website, which contains our initial project proposal and milestone report.
